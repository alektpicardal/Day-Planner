# DayPlanner

Created a calendar application that allows users to enter their daily tasks/schedules. The app runs on the users browser and features color changes depending on the time, availibility, and scheduled meetings. 

On the right handside, the user is able to 'lock' on the scheduler - meaning they can save their request locally. 


## Purpose and Requirement

As an employee with a busy schedule, a user can add important events to the planner so that they can manage their time effectively. This schedule is to be used between working hours (9AM to 5PM).

1. Open the web page to start using the scheduler
2. Check the time and date of the calendar
3. If the calendar is not greyed out, you may enter a planned event
4. If the calendar is green, you time slot is still vacant.
5. If the time is red, there's a current scheduled task at that time of the day. For example, if it's 12PM and there's a meeting, the calendar will display red.
6. Click on the 'lock' button to save your calendar. 
7. To delete content, simple doble click on the context in the calendar, erase, and then click on the 'lock' button to save.
8. If you refresh the page, your content will remain on the page.
9. Once the date has ended, your calendar will clear out.
